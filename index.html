      <p class="iconHEAD">Shockwave Treatment</p>
      <p>Shockwave therapy is a non-invasive way of treating chronic musculoskeletal injuries.

        At Ryan James Podiatry we are proud to be able to provide our patients with this innovative technology.

        Shockwave therapy promotes neovascularisation which promotes new circulation to the damaged tendon or fascia.

        During shockwave therapy a high intensity sound wave interacts with the tissues of the body, which promotes
        healing of the area.

        Benefits of Shockwave therapy: <br>

      <ul>
        <li>No anaesthesia</li>
        <li>No medication</li>
        <li>High success rate</li>
        <li>Non-invasive</li>

      <p class="iconHEAD">Orthotic Therapy</p>
      <p>Orthotic therapy is used to treat biomechanical foot dysfunction.

        Foot dysfunction is when the foot is not moving as it should. This can place extra stress to bone, ligament and
        muscles of the foot.

        Our Podiatrists may recommend some form of orthotics determined on a patients individual needs this may include
        a prefabricated device, a heat moulded prefabricated device or prescription orthotics.

        Our prescription orthotics are built to meet your individual biomechanical and lifestyle needs ultilising modern
        technologies with 3D casting and highly skilled laboratory technicians.</p>
